# RAG System with Advanced Python Concepts

A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for sales teams to implement Go-To-Market (GTM) strategies. This system demonstrates advanced Python programming concepts including async programming, performance optimization, AI pipeline architecture, and production-ready patterns.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: Async document upload and processing with chunking
- **Persona-based Querying**: Context-aware responses based on user personas
- **Vector Storage**: Efficient document embedding and similarity search
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive observability, error handling, and scaling patterns
- **Advanced Python**: Demonstrates asyncio, context managers, decorators, type hints, and memory optimization

## Architecture

The system follows microservices principles with:
- FastAPI for high-performance async API
- LangChain for RAG orchestration
- Vector databases for embedding storage
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Comprehensive observability stack
